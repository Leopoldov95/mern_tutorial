1 - when using create-react app, can simply use ./ as directory
2 - geberally, bext to delete all contents of src and just use what you need (refer to app.js and index.js for template)
3 - So how MERN stack works, the client side updates the database, then the server side code reads from the database and executes
4 - so in order for the client side to use the mongoDB data, must run server FIRST before running client
5 - when running server, make sure no console.log()'s are in use otherwise base64 img will crash console/app
6 - better to use console.log(error) over console.log(error.message)
-  remember to change api url once server side has been uploaded to heroku
- can use state tomange auth page, switch between login and signup
